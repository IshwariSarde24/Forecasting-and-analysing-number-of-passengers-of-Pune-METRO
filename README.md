# Forecasting and analysing number of passengers of Pune METRO 

**Summary**

            In this project we have applied various methods of time series on the newly build pune metro station which has completed a total of 10 
            stations.The response for metro was indecisive on whether it was a profitable or non-profitable initiative. Our main aim of this project
            is to try to predictthe number of passengers to use metro over a period of time and help in developing schemes for the passengers before 
            hand if there will be increase inthe number also whether the frequency of trains should be increased in the stipulated time.
            Government is encouraging people to use public transport asmuch as possible . So on the behalf of this project we will be able to suggest
            the increase or decrease in passengers so the government will be able to use the data and reduce or increase the valuable sources that is 
            being used.
            This project uses time series to study number of passengers using metro everyday and thereby help in estimating the number of passengers that 
            may use metro in future.
