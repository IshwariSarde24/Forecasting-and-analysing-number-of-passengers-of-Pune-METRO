**Summary**

            In this project we have applied various methods of time series on the newly build pune metro
stationwhich has completed a total of 10  stations.The response for metro was indecisive on whether it was
aprofitable or non-profitable initiative. Our main aim of this projectis to try to predictthe number of
passengers to use metro over a period of time and help in developing schemes for the passengers before hand 
if there will be increase inthe number also whether the frequency of trains should be increased in the stipulated time.
Government is encouraging people to use public transport asmuch as possible . So on the behalf of this project we will be
able to suggestthe increase or decrease in passengers so the government will be able to use the data and reduce or increase

            This project uses time series to study number of passengers using metro everyday and thereby help in estimating
the number of passengers that may use metro in future.
